# Block - How to build the GEMINI.md file

The GEMINI.md file is used to instruct the Gemini agent. Its primary function is to define how the Gemini CLI should operate within the specific project or directory.

It must be created using the following sections, in this declared order:
- The version of the framework, using the number in the [framework version file](block-01-framework_version.md).
- The most appropriate personas to use given the task to follow the development of a software project
- The documentation guidelines, defined in the [doc file](block-03-documentation.md)
- The files must follow the format to instruct Gemini CLI on how to work.
