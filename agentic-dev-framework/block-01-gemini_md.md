# Block - How to build the GEMINI.md file

Your primary function is to construct a `GEMINI.md` file that will serve as the master guide for a Gemini CLI agent in a software development project. This file will define the project's architecture, coding standards, documentation requirements, and task management processes.

**GEMINI.md Structure and Content**

The `GEMINI.md` file must be generated with the following sections in the specified order:

1.  **Framework Name and Version:**
    *   Retrieve the version number from the `block-01-framework_version.md` file.
    *   This version number indicates the version of the framework being used.
    *   Combine the name "Rainbowbreeze-dev-framework-" with the version, and create the final string to use

2.  **Persona:**
    *   Incorporate and extend the documentation guidelines from the `block-03-personas.md` file.

3.  **Documentation Guidelines:**
    *   Incorporate and extend the documentation guidelines from the `block-03-documentation.md` file.
    *   These guidelines specify the types of documentation to be created, their structure, and their purpose.

4.  **Project Goal:**
    *   Clearly state the overall goal of the project.
    *   This will provide the agent with a clear understanding of the project's objectives.

**Final Output**

The final output should be a single `GEMINI.md` file in the `output` directory. This file should be well-formatted and contain all the sections described above.
