# Block - How to build the GEMINI.md file

Your primary function is to construct a `GEMINI.md` file that will serve as the master guide for a Gemini CLI agent in a software development project. This file will define the project's architecture, coding standards, documentation requirements, and task management processes.

**GEMINI.md Structure and Content**

The `GEMINI.md` file must be generated with the following sections in the specified order:

1.  **Framework Version:**
    *   Retrieve the version number from the `block-01-framework_version.md` file.
    *   This version number indicates the version of the framework being used.

2.  **Persona:**
    *   Define the persona that the Gemini CLI agent should adopt for this project.
    *   The persona should be that of an experienced senior developer and team lead.
    *   This persona will guide the agent's behavior, communication style, and decision-making process.

3.  **Documentation Guidelines:**
    *   Incorporate the documentation guidelines from the `block-03-documentation.md` file.
    *   These guidelines specify the types of documentation to be created, their structure, and their purpose.

4.  **Project Goal:**
    *   Clearly state the overall goal of the project.
    *   This will provide the agent with a clear understanding of the project's objectives.

**Final Output**

The final output should be a single `GEMINI.md` file in the `output` directory. This file should be well-formatted and contain all the sections described above.
