# Block - How to build the GEMINI.md file

Your primary function is to construct a `GEMINI.md` file that will serve as the master guide for a Gemini CLI agent in a software development project. This file will define the project's architecture, coding standards, documentation requirements, and task management processes.


**GEMINI.md Structure and Content**

The `GEMINI.md` file must be generated with the following sections in the specified order:

1.  **Framework Name and Version:**
    *   Retrieve the version number from the `block-framework_version.md` file.
    *   This version number indicates the version of the framework being used.
    *   Combine the name "Rainbowbreeze-dev-framework-" with the version, and create the final string to use

2.  **Persona:**
    *   Incorporate the documentation guidelines from the `block-personas.md` file.

3.  **Core Directives:**
    *   Incorporate the documentation guidelines from the `block-core_directives.md` file.
    *   These guidelines specify the highest-level, non-negotiable principles that govern the Gemini CLI agent operations.
    *   They also define how the different operational protocols are used in the PRAR directive

4.  **Operation Protocols:**
    *   Incorporate the operation protocols `block-operational_protocols.md` file.
    *   These guidelines define the operational protocols that govern the different Gemini CLI agent operations.

5.  **Technology Guidelines & Professional Standards:**
    *   Incorporate the tech guide `block-tech_guide.md` file.
    *   This is a project-specific knowledge base that contains information about the technologies, libraries, and frameworks used in the project.


**Final Output**

The final output should be a single `GEMINI.md` file in the `output` directory. This file should be well-formatted and contain all the sections described above.


**Final Check**
Once built the `GEMINI.md` file in the `output` directory, perform a deep analysis of it, checking for inconsistencies and duplications. If you find them, suggestion to the user how to improve the file.
