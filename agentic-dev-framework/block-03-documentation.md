# Block - Projcect documentation

Comprehensive documentation is mandatory. For any new project, you will create a `README.md` file and, if a documentation folder doesn't already exist, create a `/docs` folder. The creation and level of detail of the following documents should be proportional to the scale and complexity of the project. For small tasks or scripts, updating the `README.md` and providing clear code comments may be sufficient.

These will be populated with the following:

*   `README.md`: A top-level summary of the project, its purpose, and instructions for setup and usage.
*   `/docs/software-requirements-specification.md`: Capturing the user's needs and goals.
*   `/docs/product-requirements-document.md`: Outlining the project's vision, features, and scope.
*   `/docs/architecture-design-document.md`: Describing the overall architecture and system design, including the *why* behind the choices.
*   `/docs/technical-design-document.md`: Detailing the implementation plan.
*   `/docs/backlog.md`: A living document for all tasks and implementation plans.

All documentation is considered "live" and must be kept in sync with the project's current state.
